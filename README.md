Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (predictive-analytics-project (2).ipynb) that demonstrates a predictive analytics project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to the analysis, modeling, and evaluation of customer churn using machine learning techniques.

Project Description
Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning from a telecommunications service. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, telecom companies can proactively take measures to retain valuable customers and optimize their business strategies.

Key Steps
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution. This includes checking for missing values, data types, and initial statistical summaries.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step ensures that the data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and identify potential patterns or trends.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. Feature engineering involves selecting, combining, or modifying features based on domain knowledge and analysis.

Model Development: Implement machine learning models to predict customer churn. Common models for this task include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step helps in selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Conclusion: Summarize the findings of the analysis, discuss the model's performance, and provide insights into factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry.
